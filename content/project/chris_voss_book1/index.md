title: Never split the difference 
---
Chris Voss is a former FBI hostage negotiator. If you want to learn how to negotiate, heâ€™s your top teacher.

The author, who is a former FBI hostage negotiator, included too many hostage stories.

Chris Voss is one of the preeminent practitioners and professors of negotiating skills in the world

this book is valuable to many types of negotiating, even situations that we may not consider to be negotiating...
(like negotiating with a family member, buying a car, or working with colleagues), the stories aren't that useful and such a perspective on negotiations isn't practical.

Ask questions, collect information, and consider creative ways to get to your goals (such as non-monetary items - amenities, upgrades, positive reviews, and referrals). There is much more in the book that goes through the nuances of what to say, how to say it, and how to behave. It is a book that you need to read slowly, take notes, and practice the tips before moving on to the next chapter.

The book is filled with anecdotes that illustrate how negotiations can be very successful--or how ignoring his advice can be the route to failure. I highly recommend this book!


I've found this list of more notes you might find helpful, too: https://github.com/mgp/book-notes/blo...

I make no illusion that I'm going to become a better negotiator just by reading it. It requires re reading (which I'm planning to do) and practice and experience

Definitely worth reading multiple times. Take what you need to improve your life and enjoy the important history lessons.
