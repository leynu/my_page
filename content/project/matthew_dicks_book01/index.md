> *Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone*.

That quote from Pablo Picasso are the first words you read. [Matthew Dicks](https://matthewdicks.com/) is eccentric and his stories made me laugh ... I enjoyed the book. I picked it up after hearing an interview with Matthew on [A Productive conversation with Mike Vardy](https://productivityist.com/category/podcast/) podcast.
