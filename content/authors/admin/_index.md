I am a senior biostatistician with a particular focus on statistical methods for public health and medicine. I am interested in causal inference and general effect estimation for observational data. Being active in several medical research areas has enabled me to gain a thorough understanding of a range of statistical and methodological concepts.I am currently working with several colleagues in ....

I use [R](https://www.r-project.org/), as my primary programming language and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to create dynamic documents. This static website is created using R package, [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).

I consider myself to be an extrovert but I love solo travel for the opportunity to just be alone and observe the new place I'm in. I strongly believe that travelling alone is the most liberating thing you could ever possibly do. My profile picture was taken in the most colourful town in the world, [Guatapé](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), Colombia.

***What is the purpose of this site?***

My one goal is **to continue learning**! I believe in knowledge sharing and I want to make this space a gathering place for my observations and learnings in the area of statistics and R programming, but also in the area of personal, social and creative skills.

> "As a creative person - a maker of things - I know that one of the ways of developing new ideas, identifying new connections, and expanding my potential skill set is by constantly pursuing new learning in whatever direction my interests may point me. There is no predicting what new bit of knowledge will open a new door and expand your universe, so I simply chase my interest and consume new content, whenever my curiosity takes me."
