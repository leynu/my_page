I was listening to [Tim Ferriss's](https://twitter.com/tferriss) podcast, in which he was having a conversation with [Penn Jillette](https://twitter.com/pennjillette).Penn is an American magician, actor, musician, inventor, television presenter, and author, best known for his collaboration with fellow magician [Teller](https://twitter.com/MrTeller).

In the podcast, Penn shares the story behind the documentary [Tim's Vermeer (2013)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3089388/). The documentary follows Tim Jenison's attempts to duplicate Johannes Vermeer's painting techniques. Tim was interested in testing the hypothesis that Vermeer painted using optical devices. The paintings of Dutch artist [Johannes Vermeer](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Vermeer) are among the most beloved and revered images in the history of art. However, this movie isn't about Vermeer; it's about Tim, a man who is passionate about art and technology. His attempt to recreate a Vermeer painting shows a lot of hard work, patience, and persistence.

Was Tim able to prove anything? For the whole world, most likely not. World-class museums will continue to hold Vermeer's paintings as their greatest treasures. But to himself, definitely yes. When you put your heart and soul into something, you can accomplish anything.

I highly recommend watching this documentary as it is a really beautiful story.
