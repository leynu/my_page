title: It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work
subtitle: Jason Fried, David Heinemeier Hansson
---

In 2017, I did read [Remote: Office Not Required](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=remote+jason+fried&i=digital-text&crid=3AVZ0HQKRTI4V&sprefix=remote+jason+%2Cdigital-text%2C199&ref=nb_sb_ss_fb_1_13), a point in time when you needed to fight with your employer to work from home. On a good day, I would spend at least 2 hours commuting by public transport. Who could have imagined that working from home would almost become the default just 2 years later.

[It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work](https://www.amazon.com/Doesnt-Have-Be-Crazy-Work/dp/0062874780) is a quick and easy read that may help to make a much needed shift in many workplace cultures. The book had many valuable point that I liked in the book, here is one:

> Declaring that an unfamiliar task will yield low-hanging fruit is almost always an admission that you have little insight about what you're setting out to so. And any estimate of how much work it'll take to do something you're never tried before is likely to be off by degree of magnitude
