Researchers know that our brains have two systems: a rational system and an emotional system. [Jonathan David Haidt](https://jonathanhaidt.com/), an American social psychologist and author, developed a clever analogy. Think of your brain as a human riding on top of an elephant. In this case, **the rider** represents the rational system that solves problems. While the rider might do some analysis and decide he wants to proceed this way, it is **the elephant** that provides the power for the journey. Whether the rider leads the elephant or drags it, who would you bet on if they ever disagree? It's precisely the elephant's 6-ton weight advantage that makes adopting new behaviours so difficult.

**The path** represents the external environment and should be considered if you want this duo to move forward in a new direction. The duo is more likely to reach their destination if the distance is shortened and obstacles are removed. To lead change, you must do three things:

-   Make sure that the rider knows where the destination is, and how to get there.
-   Getting the elephant motivated requires tapping into his emotions.
-   To make progress easier, you need to shape the path.

It's a good read and I recommend it. The book reflects modern thinking, modern science, and a modern approach to understanding people, groups, and personalities. Here are some other books to help you better understand the human mind:
