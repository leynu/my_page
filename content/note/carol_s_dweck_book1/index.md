title: Mindset - The New Psychology of Success

---

Distinguished professor of psychology at Stanford University, Carol S. Dweck is one of the world's leading researchers on motivation. Her research focuses on why people succeed and how to foster it.

Here is a two-sentence summary of the book: In the world, there are two kinds of people, those who believe _things are fixed_ and those who believe _things can change_ with hard work and effort. Believe in the ladder, and success will be yours! 

After 1.5-2 hours of listening on Storytel, I gave up on this book. I couldn't quite figure out why: was it the voice of the reader or the book's content? It is true that the right attitude can help you succeed in life, as it encourages you to work hard and strive to improve your abilities. But it's not just about ideas, it's about putting them into action. Despite its title, this book does not provide much practical advice or steps one can take to achieve this goal. Most people will get a warm fuzzy feeling after reading this, thinking wow, this makes sense! After a week, it fades, and life returns to normal.

For success to be achieved, you need to have both the right attitude and the determination to succeed. Shortcuts simply don't exist. 

Does this book deserve a recommendation? Probably not. Your time would be better spent listening to her TED talks.
