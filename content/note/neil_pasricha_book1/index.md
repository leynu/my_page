title: The Happiness Equation
subtitle: Want Nothing + Do Anything=Have Everything
---

In addition to being an author and entrepreneur, [Neil Pasricha](https://www.neil.blog/about-neil) is also a podcaster and public speaker. Neil is known for being an advocate for positivity and simple pleasures. International bestsellers such as [The Happiness Equation](https://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Equation-Nothing-Anything-Everything/dp/0425277984/ref=sr_1_2?qid=1675443825&refinements=p_27%3ANeil+Pasricha&s=books&sr=1-2)  and [The Book of Awesome](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Awesome-ebook/dp/B003NX7OFA/ref=sr_1_1?crid=6QG2PAJ0QWT6&keywords=The+Book+of+Awesome&qid=1675445672&s=digital-text&sprefix=the+book+of+awesome%2Cdigital-text%2C512&sr=1-1) are among his best-known works.

My decision to read the book was based on the two podcasts I listened to with him. 

The book, however, could have been better. After a great start, it went downhill. While the chapters on happiness and living longer were excellent, the rest of the book was disappointing. Even though I enjoyed the author's positivity when discussing various subjects, I wasn't particularly fascinated. If you've read anything about habits, motivations, happiness, or positive psychology, you won't find anything new in this book. 

Pasricha divides his book into 9 secrets and I will just mention one: **Never retain**. Although our society focuses on retirement, having a purpose in life and being stimulated is so important. In Okinawa, they don't even have a word for "retirement". There is a Japanese word called _ikigai_, which means "the reason for waking up in the morning". Rather than retiring, Paschira recommends "seizing the opportunity of an exhilarating second wind".

I will never retire. I plan to travel the world while doing work that I love and enjoy!
