title: The Coaching Habit
subtitle: Say Less, Ask More & Change the Way You Lead Forever
---

The basic premise of the book is: Shut up and listen. Assume you have much to learn.
> Tame Your Advice Monster!

If you manage people or coach them, the book offers tips and insights on how to make the best use of your one-to-ones. In this book you will learn that coaching isn't about offering solutions, it's about asking questions that lead to solutions.  It provides a helpful framework for asking coaching questions:

- The *kickstart* question: "What’s on your mind?"

- The *awe* question: "And what else?"

- The *focus* question: "What’s the Real Challenge Here for You?"

- The *lazy* question: "How Can I Help?"

- The *foundation* question: "What do you want?"

- The *strategic* question: "If You’re Saying Yes to This, What Are You Saying No To?"

- The *learning* question: "What was most useful for you?"

[Thecoachinghabit.com](https://go.mbs.works/tch-vault) offers companion training videos and downloads "that supplement and deepen your reading experience". You can also find five brief videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL68j6QKmutRmdlwx42dZzAXW0gbQzLMqK) illustrating each principle - they are short conversations between [Marshall Goldsmith](https://marshallgoldsmith.com/) and Michael Bungay Stanier (the author). The book also refers to many business books (about building good habits, motivating employees, decision-making, etc.).

In case you are interested, I recommend that you read the printed book rather than the Kindle version. There are so many parts to underline and so many annotations to make, so a pen and paper are a must.
