title: Four Thousand Weeks 
subtitle: Time Management for Mortals
---

This book does not offer cheap _time hacks_ to get more done. It’s provocative, entertaining, and genuinely useful and it offers really helpful suggestions and insights. It is based on two uncomfortable but crucial truths: 

- In the short 4000 or so weeks you have to live, you will never be able to accomplish all the things you would like to do or other people want you to do 

- Even if you could, it wouldn’t matter in the end, in the words of [William Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wallace): 

> All men die, but not all men really live.

[Edward T. Hall](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_T._Hall) ones pointed out: 

> Time feels like an unstoppable conveyor belt, bringing us new tasks as fast as we can dispatch the old ones; and becoming 'more productive' just seems to cause the belt to speed up

A core idea of this book is simple: pursue activities you enjoy while accepting your limitations and committing to what's most important to you. 

This is one of the books I recommend to everyone. More information about the book can be found [here](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/fourhours).
